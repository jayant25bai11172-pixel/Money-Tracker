1. WHAT THE PROJECT DOES?

As the name of the project suggests, it tracks or in other words we can say that it keeps a record of the user's expenses.

2. WHY THE PROJECT IS USEFUL?

It helps the user to keep a record of the expenses spent by the user at specific date on a specific material so that the user can manage the expenses according to their respective needs in order not to face any major financial problems in the near future. The project is very useful for college students or for the people who have recently started to manage their own expenses. For a college student, it is very useful as the user has limitated amount of money for a specific amount of time and it becomes very difficult for many people to manage without tracking their expense and later end up exhausting their resources before time. Using this , now the user can keep a record of their expense with every important information such as date, amount spent, name of the material amount is spent on and more.

3. HOW USERS CAN GET STARTED WITH THE PROJECT?

To get started, user must run the code. When the code runs, it will display the EXPENSE TRACKER MENU with 5 options which will be to add, remove and view the expenses individually, to view the total expense and to exit the program. If the user wants to add the add the expense into the program, respective option should be selected by typing the serial number of the required option. Then the program will ask for the date (in DD-MM-YYYY Format) which needs to be filled in the required format only followed by the description of the material where the user can give the name of the material as per the user's needs(only alphabet should be used, avoiding the use of any kind of numeric, alphanumeric or special character). After a description is given, program will ask for the amount of money spent on the material( only numeric characters must be used). After the completetion of filling up these details, the program will save the data, displaying the message of successfully adding the expense. Similarly, more expenses can be added into the program and can be removed if the user do not want them anymore. Viewing the individual and total expenses also have same method, only the difference is that if the user wants to view the individual expense, SHOW ALL option should be selected and if total expenses was to be viewed, TOTAL MONEY SPENT option must be chosen. Now to exit from the program, user simply needs to type the serial number of the option EXIT, and the user will exit from the program.
